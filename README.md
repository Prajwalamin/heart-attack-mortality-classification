# Heart Attack Mortality Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying 1-year patient mortality following a heart attack. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of mortality within the first year post-heart attack.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. (Specify versions in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-attack-mortality-classification.git
   cd heart-attack-mortality-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
